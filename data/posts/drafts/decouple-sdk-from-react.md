Suppose I use an external service provider to process payments for my E-commerce app, and I need to embed some external SDK code to integrate the payment service into my app.

In this oversimplified example, let‚Äôs say the payment service is responsible for checking whether a given payment method (e.g, Apple Pay and Google Pay) is available based on the customer‚Äôs device, region, etc. While my ‚Äúcore‚Äù UI component `PaymentOptions` is responsible for rendering the available payment methods as options. Lastly, I want the flexibility of adding new payment methods in the future (for üìàüí∞reasons).

I can write it this way.

However, the UI code is tightly coupled with the external code from the payment service, i.e., **I have to modify the**  **`PaymentOptions` component in order to add a new payment method or to make SDK updates.**
***

I can perhaps break out the SDK code into a separate hook.

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/05b0dabbd467a37ec410c8efc6b6f94f %}

**However, I _still_ have to modify**  **`PaymentOptions`**  **and any other components that share the**  **`usePaymentMethods` hook if I wanted to add, for example,**  **`isPaypalAvailable`.**
***

To minimize the size of future PRs, I‚Äôve been thinking about the Open/Closed Principle, the ‚ÄúO‚Äù in SOLID (check out this excellent [explainer](https://medium.com/better-programming/revisiting-solid-927e6a5202d3)): ‚Äú_A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.‚Äù_

In my own words: _I should design this feature in such a way that I don‚Äôt have to touch any of the original code I wrote (closed for modification) if I were to add new payment methods in the future (open for extension)._

Here‚Äôs my take on this principle. Let‚Äôs separate the payment service into its own module: a simple object where each key represents a payment method. Every payment method key points to an object with an `isAvailable` property (a function that uses the SDK code) and a `component` property (the UI component for the payment option).

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/7a3365d6e85f1d236fca12fcc4bba348 %}

Import `paymentServiceModule` into the `PaymentOptions` component.

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/b24d91ae215e6b4ba839a0f9bf9ba462 %}

`PaymentOptions` is now decoupled from the SDK implementation details, and is ignorant of the particular payment methods.

When I want to extend this feature with a new payment method (i.e., PayPal), **I simply slot in a new key/value pair to `paymentServiceModule` without having to modify either the `PaymentOptions` component or the original payment methods**.

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/1b7d7ac0a6faf4838a169be094cba14a %}

The UI code should in theory also be protected against modification if I were to change payment service providers (for üí∏ reasons) as long as the payment method‚Äôs duck typing remains unchanged.

Am I applying the Open/Closed Principle correctly? Curious to learn other React or JavaScript patterns in the wild that follow this principle.

### Bonus
In `paymentServiceModule`, lazy load each payment option using the [`React.lazy`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) API.

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/3b3055a9ad84e5bc1b12d423fc2bad6b %} 

In `PaymentOptions`, wrap each payment option in `Suspense`, to lazy load the component based on availability.
