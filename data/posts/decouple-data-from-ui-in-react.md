In [Part 1](https://dev.to/suhanw/decouple-data-from-ui-with-react-hooks-3amn), I presented an approach to decouple the data fetching/management layer from the UI, which would free us from being locked into any particular data library or framework. Let’s call this **Approach A**.

### Approach A. Custom Hook

Let’s create a custom hook — `useSomeData` — that returns the properties `someData`, `loading`, and `error` regardless of the data fetching/management logic. The following are 3 different implementations of `useSomeData`.

_With Fetch API and component state:_

_With Redux:_

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/aac361c9ab4856eed2cf5d5531ce655b %}

_With Apollo GraphQL:_

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/eaeebbf6afd44b7b5509ec74a27656f7 %}

The 3 implementations above are **interchangeable** without having to modify this UI component:

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/a08783eb6302899bb91a88572a2ac86c %}

But, as [Julius Koronci](https://medium.com/u/3efad7746b00) correctly pointed out, while the data fetching/management logic is decoupled, the `SomeComponent` UI is still coupled to the `useSomeData` hook.

In other words, even though we can reuse `useSomeData` without `SomeComponent`, **we cannot reuse**  **`SomeComponent` without**  **`useSomeData`.**

Perhaps this is where Render Props and Higher Order Components do a better job at enforcing the separation of concerns (thanks again to Julius for highlighting this).

### Approach B. Render Props

Instead of a custom hook that returns `someData`, `loading`, and `error`, let’s create a Render Props component — `SomeData` — that wraps around a function (i.e., children needs to be a function), implements the data logic, and passes in `someData`, `loading`, and `error` into the function.

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/263c954810fc5ab69292ed256e1494aa %}

You can replace line 4 in the snippet above with Redux, Apollo GraphQL, or any data fetching/management layer of your choice.

**We can now reuse** **`SomeComponent` (UI component) without** **`SomeData` (Render Props component). We can also reuse**  **`SomeData` without**  **`SomeComponent`.**

***

### Approach C. Higher Order Components (HOC)

Let’s create a HOC — `withSomeData` — that accepts a React component as an argument, implements the data logic, and passes `someData`, `loading`, and `error` as props into the wrapped React component.

{% gist https://gist.github.com/suhanw/106e18601dff30a7d3f73a77ab2f861c %}

You can replace line 5 in the snippet above with Redux, Apollo GraphQL, or any data fetching/management layer of your choice.

**We can now reuse** **`SomeComponent` (UI component) without** **`withSomeData` (HOC). We can also reuse**  **`withSomeData` without**  **`SomeComponent`.**

Today I learned.

Which approach do you prefer and why?
