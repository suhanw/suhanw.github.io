I used to think that accessibility is at best a UX improvement, and at worst ‚Äúcompliance work‚Äù. But as the pandemic turned [Boxed.com](https://www.boxed.com) into an essential service for many of our customers, I have read a good number of heartbreaking customer service tickets that revealed my biases and the unintended exclusions caused by my code. Now, I‚Äôm convinced that making the web accessible is the _right thing to do._

Accessibility is a broad topic, and a subset of loftier [inclusive design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) principles that I won‚Äôt pretend to be an expert on. I‚Äôm just sharing one of the many a11y lessons I learned as a developer.

So let‚Äôs move on to the main topic.

We love our `div` tags. But, simply from a developer experience standpoint without even discussing the merits of [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantics_in_HTML) (which deserves its own article), **a**  **`button` is _more accessible with less code_ compared to a clickable `div`**. To illustrate, let‚Äôs go ahead and create a clickable div.

```html
<div>Click me</div>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log('do something'); 
  }

  document.querySelector('div').onclick = doSomething;
</script>
```

Not good enough, we need to visually indicate through the cursor type that the div is clickable (which apparently is also [debatable](https://medium.com/simple-human/buttons-shouldnt-have-a-hand-cursor-b11e99ca374b)). Let‚Äôs add some CSS.

```html
<style>
  .someDiv {
    cursor: pointer;
  }
</style>

<div class='someDiv'>Click me</div>
```

Not good enough, we need to verbally indicate through screen readers that the `div` is a clickable button, and it needs to be keyboard accessible via Tabbing navigation. Let‚Äôs add [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role) and [tabindex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) attributes.

```html
<div class='someDiv' tabindex='0' role='button'>Click me</div>
```

Not good enough, the `div` also needs to be keyboard accessible via Enter and Space Bar keys. Let‚Äôs add more JavaScript (which may not even be 100% [cross-browser compatible](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values#Whitespace_keys)).

```html
<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log('do something'); 
  }

  function handleKeydown(e) {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
      doSomething();
    }
  }

  document.querySelector('div').onclick = doSomething;
  document.querySelector('div').onkeydown = handleKeydown;
</script>
```

So finally, we end up with this.

```html
<style>
  .someDiv {
    cursor: pointer;
  }
</style>

<div class='someDiv' tabindex='0' role='button'>Click me</div>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log('do something'); 
  }

  handleKeydown(e) {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === 'Space Bar') {
      doSomething();
    }
  }

  document.querySelector('div').onclick = doSomething;
  document.querySelector('div').onkeydown = handleKeydown;
</script>
```

Whereas, the `button` version that‚Äôs _equally accessible_ looks like this.

```html
<button>Click here</button>

<script>
  function doSomething() {
    console.log('do something'); 
  }

  document.querySelector('button').onclick = doSomething;
</script>
```

What‚Äôs your approach to creating clickable UI components? Let me know in the comments.

Note: I decided not to discuss aria attributes because I think they deserve their own article.
